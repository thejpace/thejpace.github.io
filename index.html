    Gareth Couch, proud American and former member of the Boy Scouts of America, was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  He served two distinguished terms as Fire Marshall, where he won the prestigious Wolfgang Puck Golden Fire Bucket award three times.  He is married to his elementary school sweetheart and dog grooming magnate, Virginia Donahue-Couch.  They, and their beautiful three children, are world renowned for their involvement in canine rights and fireplace evangelism.

    He decided to enter the presidential race after seeing the issues concerning canine rights and fireplace evangelism were being ignored by other candidates.  He promises that with his election, there will be a dog on every couch and a fireplace in every home.
