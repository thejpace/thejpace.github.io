        <h4>Dogs in Government</h4>
            <p> "The loyalty and steadfast morality of dogs should not only be inspirational to our human policymakers, but should be made available for a collaborative and inclusive government, that represents the interests of both our human and canine citizens. It's time to give a voice to those who have been barking for change."</p>


         <h4> Three Day Weekend</h4>
            <p> "The importance of a three day weekend cannot be understated, the weekend is the bedrock of a healthy, productive, and prosperous family, society, and nation.

            <p> "Access to cozy fires should not be restricted to the privileged few, it should be made available to every citizen regardlesss of housing situation. By doing this we can warm not only our nations homes, but our nations hearts."</p>


          <h4> Reuniting America and the U.K.</h4>
              <p> "To reunite America with its mother country would be like reuniting a family after a particularly brutal holiday dinner argument. To do so, would uphold the family values that we as a nation believe in. It's time to heal the wounds and reunite our two countries as one unified family striding towards a greater future for all."</p>
